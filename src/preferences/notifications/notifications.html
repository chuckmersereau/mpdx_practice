<h3 translate>Notifications</h3>
<p translate>
    Based on an analysis of a partner's giving history, MPDX can notify you
    of events that you will probably want to follow up on. The detection logic
    is based on a set of rules that are right most of the time, but you will
    still want to verify an event manually before contacting the partner.
</p>
<p translate>
    For each event MPDX can notify you via email and also create a task entry
    reminding you to do something about it. The options below allow you to
    control that behavior.
