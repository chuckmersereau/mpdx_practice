                    limitations set out in applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                <p class="f4">If you ask us, we will provide you with a copy of your personal information free of
                    charge. We may charge you a fee to cover our administrative costs if you request multiple copies of

                <ul class="f4">
                    <li>you dispute the accuracy of your personal information;</li>
                    <li>your personal information was processed unlawfully and you request a limitation on processing,
                        rather than a deletion of your personal information;
                    </li>
                    <li>we no longer need to process your personal information, but you need your personal information
                        in connection with a legal claim; or
                    </li>
                    <li>you object to the processing of your personal information based on our legitimate interests
                        pending verification as to whether we have an overriding legitimate ground for such processing.

                </ul>
                <p class="f4">To the extent needed, we may still keep some of your data to ensure we comply with your
                    request to limit processing, or for other legal purposes.</p>
                <h3><b>e. Objecting to certain types of processing including automated decision making.</b></h3>
                <p class="f4">Where we process your personal information based upon our legitimate interests, you have
                    the right to object to this processing on grounds relating to your particular situation if you feel
                    it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
                <p class="f4">Where we process your personal information based upon our legitimate interests and where
                    decisions are made by automated processing which has a legal or other significant effect on you, you
                    may also object to such automated decision making.</p>
                <h3><b>f. Portability of personal information.</b></h3>
                <p class="f4">You can request us to send you your personal information in a structured, commonly used,
                    machine-readable format so that it can easily be transferred and used by a third party if:</p>

                    <li>the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><b>g. Withdrawing consent.</b></h3>
                <p class="f4">We primarily rely on legitimate business interests to process your data, but to the extent
                    we use consent to process your data, you have the right to withdraw any consent you may have given
                    us at any time. We will comply with your request promptly.</p>
                <p class="f4">If you withdraw your consent, we might not be able to provide some of our products and
                    services to you. At any point, you have the right to object to processing of your personal
                    information for direct marketing purposes and we will promptly comply with your request.</p>
                <h3><b>h. Filing a complaint with a data protection authority.</b></h3>
                <p class="f4">We will try to resolve any problems that you have but you are always able to contact your
                    local data protection authority for assistance or to make a complaint.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3><b>7. International transfer of your personal information.</b></h3>
                <p class="f4">We are an international organisation and we might need to transfer your personal
                    information to other countries. If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), please be aware that
                    we may need to transfer your data to countries outside the EEA to process it. We will only transfer
                    your personal information outside the EEA with adequate safeguards in place and in full compliance
                    with applicable laws. For example, we will only transfer your personal information to countries that
                    have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection. We have established standard
                    contractual clauses with our service providers to ensure they protect your information and to
                    enforce legal transfers of data internationally.</p>

                <h3><b>8. Security.</b></h3>
                <p class="f4">We have put in place appropriate security measures to protect your personal information
                    from being accidentally lost, misused or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
                    These include technical, administrative and physical security measures to ensure that any
                    information we collect is stored and processed securely.</p>
                <p class="f4">For example, for Digital Tools that require personal or sensitive data to be collected or
                    displayed, a Secured Socket Layer (SSL) connection is required, to ensure that the data is encrypted
                    as it is transferred to the browser. All credit card payments are processed using PCI compliant
                    technology, to ensure that your credit card number is securely passed to the merchant/service
                    provider. We do not store your credit card details.</p>
                <p class="f4">We have procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and we will promptly
                    notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach in accordance with our legal obligations.</p>
                <p class="f4">We cannot guarantee that the security measures we implement in connection with the
                    operation of the site will absolutely prevent others from accessing or acquiring any information
                    that you provide while using the site. You can help us protect your personal information by properly
                    protecting your password and remembering to sign out of your account and close your browser window

                <p class="f4">We do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13 beyond what is
                    necessary for them to participate in our online or other activities, such as registering for a
                    conference or downloading materials. If we discover that we have accidentally collected personal
                    information from a child below the age of 13, we will delete it from our records as soon as
                    reasonably possible.</p>
                <p class="f4">If a child,&nbsp;under the age of 16 in the EEA,&nbsp;or under the age of 13 elsewhere,
                    attempts to register with one of our Digital Tools, purchase products or materials, or participate
                    in an activity requiring the submittal of personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian
                    must give permission and consent for that child to provide information and register. The only
                    personal information we collect from a child is information that is necessary for the child to
                    participate in activities, such as an address for making a purchase. Parents have the right to
                    request at any time that the information collected about their child is removed from our
                    database.</p>
