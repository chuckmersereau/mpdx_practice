Please read our Terms of Use (the “Terms of Use”) to find out more about the requirements for using this Site.</br>
2. Collection and Use of Information.</br>
We take your privacy very seriously.  You can visit and enjoy many of our Sites without disclosing any personal information about yourself. There may be times when you will have the opportunity to share limited, personally identifiable information to access or utilize certain features of this Site.  We limit our collection of personal information to pertinent information for the activity you choose to undertake.  For example, in order to communicate better with you, we may collect your name, e-mail address, phone number, etc.  Depending on which features you choose to interact with, we may also need to collect other personal information.</br>
Generally, we will not disclose or share any visitor information (including your e-mail address) with anyone outside Our Organization without your permission. There may be times that we need to use your information in order to provide you with ministry services or products.  For example, we may need to use or share your information with our partners and agents who provide goods and services to you on our behalf.  We also may need to share your information with other parts of Our Organization to service your requests or provide you with information or other ministry opportunities.  Lastly, we may need to use your information if required for us to comply with legal requirements pertaining to your information or activities, or to enforce our rights as agreed under the Terms of Use.  In all such efforts we will take steps to safeguard your information.

We give visitors to certain Sites the opportunity to register or provide their contact information such as their e-mail address so they can receive updates such as news reports, project or organization reports, opportunities for personal and financial involvement and promotional information.  You may also be required to register on the Site to engage in other activities, such as purchases or downloads of materials, services, products, donations, receiving promotions, registering for conferences or activities, or registering for chat rooms or public forums.

4. Security.</br>
For Sites that collect information, we typically employ security measures, including technical, administrative, and physical security steps to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control.  For example, the Site may use a Secured Socket Layer (SSL) server for activities such as order forms, and for users to download information and materials.  For this, users need to provide contact information (such as name and e-mail addresses).  Information that is collected from a person may be used to verify their qualifications for registration and for all purposes related to the transaction. These uses could include processing your order, transmitting information to the participating service provider, and authenticating the information you have provided.</br>
We cannot guarantee that the security measures we implement in connection with the operation of the Site will absolutely prevent others from accessing or acquiring any information that you provide while using the Site.  You can do some things to help protect the security of your information.  For instance, never give out your password since this is what is used to access all of your account information.  Also, remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish visiting our Site, so that other people using the same computer will not have access to your information.</br>

Also, any information you submit to our Sites is the property of our Sites unless the Site indicates otherwise.  If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public (in any Forum, message board, or “chat” environment), you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</br>
